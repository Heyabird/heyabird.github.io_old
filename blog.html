            <p>Heya, World! This is the first blog post on my newly-birthed self-made website. In my first post, I wanted to tell you a bit about how I started my coding journey. </p>
            <br/>
            <h5>From philosophy and art to code...</h5>
            <p>During college and 2.5 years after college, I immersed myself in philosophy, art, and music. As you might know, thse are not the most "practical" fields in terms of generating a sustainable income, but I am happy that I "naively" explored those passions before I tapped into something more "practical". This is because, during the last 2.5 years living as a deep thinker and artist, I could start cultivating a <strong>‚ú®vision‚ú®</strong> for myself.</p>
            <p>First, by studying philosophy and art at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, I learned alot about the world (and had alot of questions about it). My major was the infamously rigorous College of Social Studies (a writing- and reading-intensive program that combines philosophy, history, economics, and politics). I also took a good amount of art and art history courses, graduating 1 credit short of also being a Studio Art major. Outside of classrooms, I acquired interesting experiences (TAing at a maximum-security prison, interpreting for North Korean refugees, making a graphic novel after interviewing factory workers in 13 Chinese cities, starting a community magazine, etc.). College was where I could safely be an idealist; there, I studied the world, questioned the meaning of life, and identified some of the problems in our society I want to solve.</p>
            <p>When I moved to Los Angeles after college, I found myself living as an artist. I was hustling, doing various creative contract works (designing posters & logos, curating shows, ghost-producing music, singing, DJing, content writing, etc.). I also worked in a design agency, a cafe, a grocery store, an event-planning organization, a music school, and a startup. Doing so, I started to expand my creative muscle and began imagining out-of-the-box solutions to the social problems I learned about during college and post-college.</p>
            <p>With so many questions in my head and so many problems I want to solve, the natural next step for me was to learn coding. I had so many ideas to help the world, but I needed a practical tool to solve real life problems. And, to be very honest, I was starting to feel depressed in my life in LA, where I felt like I was putting too much energy worrying about money rather than challenging myself to live my full potential. Because I have a background in graphic design, I started off taking a full-time online UX design course via Bloc, only to realize I liked their sub-course on coding more than the main UX course (I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and creative the process of coding felt). I also missed having an in-person learning community, but I didn't want to take out an enormous loan nor go through the bureacratic hoops that traditional schools require. So, I started to look at bootcamps.</p>
            <br/>
            <h5>LEARNing how to code @ LEARN, San Diego</h5>
            <p>This is when I decided to move to San Diego and attend a coding bootcamp called <strong><a id="aspecial" href="https://www.learnacademy.org/">LEARN Academy</strong></a>. I did a rigorous amount of research and weighed my options for bootcamps. I looked at the giant corporate bootcamps in Los Angeles and San Francisco, but LEARN in San Diego ended up winning my heart. This was not only because my brother lived in San Diego and San Diego has better beaches than the other two cities; when I read student testimonals on LEARN's website and listened to LEARN C.E.O. Chelsea Kaufman talk with community members on LEARN's <strong><a id="aspecial" href="https://www.collaborationcoderadio.com/">Collaboration Code Radio</a></strong>, I instantly knew that this was the place for me. I could tell that LEARN really cares about fostering a family and attracted people who cares about collaboration. I also appreciated that LEARN has heavy women leadership involvement compared to other coding bootcamps. So, I sold my Tesla stocks, took out a loan, applied for a scholarship, and committed.</p>
            <p>I plan to write more on my LEARNing journey on a separate post, but I really wanted to give a shout-out to LEARN here, because it has offered me so much. Perhaps because it is a small local startup, or because it focuses so much on growth and collaboration, LEARN carries a strange sense of warmth to it that other corporate bootcamps lack. I think I was lucky too, as the 18 other students in my current cohort (named 'Alpha 2020') happen to be terribly kind, authentic, talented, and funny (seriously, there are so many moments in class I cannot breathe because I am laughing so hard). The instructors and staffs are also so genuine, supportive, and GOOD at their job -- it really made my transition into the coding world so exciting. </p>
            <p>Two months into LEARNing, I have already been building full-stack <strong><a id="aspecial" href="index.html#projects">projects</a></strong> that aim to tackle real life issues. It would be a lie if I said this has been an easy journey (I am completely out of my comfort zone, and my brain is fried every week from so much learning üòµ), but choosing to learn how to code, especially through LEARN, has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I am excited to see how my soft and hard skills can combine with my new tech skills to produce creative and practical projects. </p>
            <p>My learning journey is to be continued...! üå± </p>
