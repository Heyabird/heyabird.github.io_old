      <p>Heya, World! Guess what? Since my last post about learning how to code, I did a three month internship with <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/evealed-inc/">an EV app startup</a> and currently working for <a id="aspecial" href="https://www.thenomadik.com/">a subscription box startup</a> as a web developer! Now that I have settled into my new job, I wanted to start doing more self-learning. 
      <br/> <br/>
      I chose to self-study Ruby on Rails because I have learned the basic foundation of it in my coding bootcamp and know it's a very enjoyable framework to use. Plus, I have been using Javascript and Django in my current work and I wanted to practice something different to continue challenging myself. Thus, I started reading the well-respected book <a id="aspecial" target="_blank"  href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl. I'll be back to update you on my Rails journey!</p>

          <p>Heya, World! This is the first blog post on my newly-birthed website. In my first post, I wanted to share how I started my coding journey. </p>
          <br/>
          <h5>From philosophy and art to code...</h5>
          <p>During college and 2.5 years after college, I immersed myself in philosophy, art, and music. As you might know, these are not the most "practical" fields in terms of generating a sustainable income, but I am happy that I "naively" explored those passions before I tapped into something more "practical". This is because, while studying liberal arts in college and living as an artist for a few years after college, I could start cultivating a <strong>vision</strong> for myself.</p>
          <p>First, by studying social science/philosophy and art at Wesleyan University, I learned alot about the world (and had alot of questions about it). My major was the <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/css/" id="aspecial" target="_blank">College of Social Studies</a> (a writing- and reading-intensive program that combines philosophy, history, economics, and politics). I also took a good amount of art and art history courses, graduating 1 credit short of also being a Studio Art major. Outside of classrooms, I acquired interesting and life-changing experiences (TAing at a maximum-security prison, interpreting for North Korean refugees, making a <a href="https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2757&context=etd_hon_theses" id="aspecial" target="_blank">graphic novel</a> after interviewing factory workers in 13 Chinese cities, starting a community magazine, etc.). College was where I could safely be an idealist; there, I studied the world, questioned the meaning of life, and identified some of the problems in our society I want to solve.</p>
          <p>When I moved to Los Angeles after college, I found myself living as an artist. I was hustling, doing various creative contract works (designing posters & logos, curating shows, ghost-producing & "singing/rapping" for other musicians, DJing, content writing, etc.). I also worked in a <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="http://www.socialclubcreative.com/">design agency</a>, <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="https://www.cafedeleche.net/">a cafe</a>, <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="http://latropicanamarket.com/">a grocery store</a>, an event-planning organization, <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="https://beatlabacademy.com/">a music production school</a>, and <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="https://www.startengine.com/">a tech startup</a>. Outside of work, I was also building <a id="aspecial" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=heya+%E3%85%8E%E3%85%87">my own brand as a musician</a> and throwing events at local venues. Doing so, I started to expand my creative muscle and began imagining out-of-the-box solutions to the social problems I learned about during college and post-college.</p>
          <p>With so many questions in my head and so many problems I want to solve, the natural next step for me was to learn coding. I had a plethora of ideas to help the world, but I needed a practical tool to solve real life problems. And, to be very honest, I was starting to feel depressed in my life in LA, where I felt like I was putting too much energy worrying about money rather than challenging myself to live my full potential. Because I have a background in graphic design, I started off taking an online UX design course via Bloc, only to realize I liked their sub-course on coding more than the main UX course (Don't get me wrong - I loved the UX part as well, but I also wanted to dive deeper into the code ;)). I also missed having an in-person learning community, but I didn't want to take out an enormous loan nor go through the bureacratic hoops that traditional schools require. So, I started to look at bootcamps.</p>
          <br/>
          <h5>LEARNing how to code @ LEARN, San Diego</h5>
          <p>This is when I decided to move to San Diego and attend a coding bootcamp called <strong><a id="aspecial" href="https://www.learnacademy.org/">LEARN Academy</strong></a>. I did a good amount of research and weighed my options. I looked at the giant corporate bootcamps in LA and SF, but LEARN in San Diego ended up winning my heart. This was not only because my brother lived in San Diego and San Diego has better beaches than the other two cities ðŸ˜›; when I read student testimonals and listened to LEARN's <strong><a id="aspecial" href="https://www.collaborationcoderadio.com/">Collaboration Code Radio</a></strong>, I could tell that LEARN really cares about fostering a collaborative community in San Diego. I also appreciated that LEARN has heavy women leadership involvement compared to other coding bootcamps. So, I sold my Tesla stocks (rip ðŸ’€), took out a loan, applied for a scholarship, and committed.</p>
          <p>I really wanted to give a shout-out to LEARN here, because it has offered me so much. Perhaps because it is a small local startup, or because it focuses so much on personal growth and collaboration, LEARN carries a strange sense of warmth to it that other corporate bootcamps lack. I think I was lucky too, as the 18 other students in my current cohort (named 'Alpha 2020') happen to be super kind, authentic, talented, and funny (seriously, there are so many moments in class I cannot breathe because I was LOLing so hard). The instructors and staffs are so genuine, supportive, and good at their jobs -- it really made my transition into the coding world so exciting. </p>
          <p>Two months into LEARNing, I have been building full-stack <strong><a id="aspecial" href="index.html#projects">projects</a></strong> that respond to real-life issues. It would be a lie if I said this has been an easy journey (I am completely out of my comfort zone, and my brain is fried every week from so much learning ðŸ˜µ), but choosing to learn how to code, especially through LEARN, has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I am excited to see how my soft and hard skills can combine with my new tech skills to produce creative and practical projects. </p>
          <p>My learning journey is to be continued...! ðŸŒ± </p>
