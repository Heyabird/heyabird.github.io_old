# Heya in an Elevator
## 2 minute pitch:

Hello, my name is Heya. I am a new full-stack developer to San Diego, skilled in React and Ruby on Rails, and I  also identify as a full-stack creative.

I have a background in the arts/entertainment and philosophy. I was born in Seoul under two visual artists as my parents and naturally developed a keen eye for aesthetics and detail. I then went to Wesleyan University in Connecticut to study social philosophy and art. For my graduation thesis, I received a grant to travel and interview factory workers in China in 13 different factories to make a graphic novel. The graphic novel was about how modern technology (like machines and smartphones) affects the daily lives of everyday people. That is when I realized -- technology matters alot. (by the way, you can find the link to this project in my website, heyakwon.com)

After college, I spent 3 years working in the arts and entertainment industry in Seoul and Los Angeles. I curated art shows, managed artists, directed music videos, distributed films, and sold my own designs and music to various individuals and corporates.

Now I am here, in beautiful San Diego, using programming as a way to combine my passion for identifying social problems on a philosophical level and finding creative and practical solutions for them. I studied Javascript, React, and Ruby on Rails through a rigorous coding bootcamp called LEARN, and I have also been studying Python on my own and working on a machine learning project. Eventually, I would like to use all my thinking, coding, and artistic skills to be a forerunner in the AI industry and explore how AIs can be an exciting, creative, and practical solution to societal issues. I am especially interested in the connection between AI technology and visual/videographic data.

I am currently looking for both job opportunities and other opportunities to connect and collaborate on independent tech projects. If you want to work with me and want more info, you can find my website: www.heyakwon.com.
